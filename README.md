# Rhesus

## An Educational Medical Simulation Game

**Rhesus** is an interactive, text-based educational game designed specifically for internal medicine residents to sharpen clinical reasoning, diagnostic skills, and decision-making under pressure.

### Features
- **Realistic Patient Simulations:** AI-driven scenarios covering cardiovascular, infectious diseases, emergency medicine, and miscellaneous internal medicine cases.
- **Dynamic Clinical Responses:** Accurate physiological reactions to treatments (e.g., medications like metoprolol) with regularly updated vitals (HR, BP, MAP, RR, Temp).
- **Interactive Communication:** Engage with AI-based Attending Physicians (`@md`) and Nurses (`@rn`) through realistic clinical dialogues.
- **Accelerated Time Pressure:** Manage cases efficiently with an accelerated in-game clock, creating an engaging clinical urgency.
- **Performance Tracking:** Scoring system to assess clinical decision-making, rewarding efficiency and accuracy, with points deducted for mistakes.
- **Transparent API Cost Counter:** Track real-time API usage cost during gameplay.

### Game Interface
The interface consists of three panels:
- **Data Panel:** Patient clinical data and case details.
- **Results Panel:** Continuously updating vital signs, lab results, patient updates, and chat interactions.
- **Actions Panel:** Perform clinical actions (order drugs, labs, physical exams) via intuitive clickable buttons.

### Technical Information
- **Platform:** GitHub Pages
- **Technology Stack:** HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript, PPQ.AI API
- **AI Integration:** Patient simulation, clinical reasoning, and interactive communication powered by the PPQ.AI API.
