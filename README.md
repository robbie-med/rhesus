# Rhesus ‚öïÔ∏èüôà

A text-based healthcare simulation game designed for medical students and interns to practice clinical reasoning skills in a realistic, interactive environment.

## Features

- **Case Categories**: Cardiovascular, Infectious Disease, Emergency, and Miscellaneous
- **Real-time Vital Signs**: Updates every 10 seconds, with medically accurate responses to interventions
- **Interactive Communication**: Chat with attending physicians and nurses using `@md` and `@rn` prefixes
- **Comprehensive Medical Actions**: Order medications, labs, imaging, perform exams, request consults, and more
- **Scoring System**: Points deducted for harmful or unnecessary actions
- **API Cost Tracking**: Monitor the cost of AI interactions

## How to Play

1. **Select a Case Type**: Choose from Cardiovascular, Infectious Disease, Emergency, or Miscellaneous
2. **Start the Case**: Click the "Start Case" button to begin the simulation
3. **Review Patient Information**: Read the demographics, chief complaint, and history in the Data panel
4. **Monitor Vital Signs**: Keep track of the patient's vitals in the Results panel
5. **Take Actions**: Use the Actions panel to order medications, labs, imaging, perform exams, etc.
6. **Communicate**: Chat with the attending physician using `@md` and the nurse using `@rn`
7. **Track Your Score**: Aim for the highest score possible (closest to zero) by making appropriate clinical decisions

## Time Scale

- Game time runs at an accelerated pace
- Each 10 seconds of real-time equals approximately 1 minute of in-game time
- Vital signs update every 10 seconds

## API Integration

The game uses the PPQ.AI (https://ppq.ai) API with GTP-4o to generate patient cases, respond to clinical interventions, and provide realistic responses from attending physicians and nurses.

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5
- No external dependencies or frameworks
- Designed to run on GitHub Pages
- Uses the PPQ.AI API for intelligent clinical reasoning

## Educational Purpose

This simulation is designed for educational purposes to help medical students and interns practice:
- Clinical decision making
- Patient management
- Communication with healthcare team members
- Resource utilization awareness
